# Card-Bomber

This is the final project of my grade 11 computer science course. This game is spin on Minesweeper. There is a grid of square cards, which can contain a number value or a bomb. Each row and column has a clue indicating the total of cards values and number of bombs. Hitting too many bombs will end the game. The program reads and writes to high score to the HighScore.txt, which must be in the same folder as the java files.

HSA Console library is required to run this game. For more information, read User's Manual.docx and go to https://danielkhliang.wixsite.com/website/java.
